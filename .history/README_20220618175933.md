# Kierancli.

Kierancli uses a mode system for accessing different functionality.
The command "mode x" allows switching between different modes. currently there are 3 modes:
rust (default), program and gitclone.

## Installation / Updating.
``curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KieranCrossland/kierancli/master/kierancli-install.sh | sh``

On GNU/Linux the shell script kierancli-install.sh
will download, install and update kierancli to its latest version on Git master.

The program will be installed to ~/.local/share/kierancli/bin ,however the install location can be easily changed by editing the script.

## Rust mode.
This mode allows execution of hard-coded functionality such as kierancli's pwd, ls, help, etc.

## Gitclone mode.
This mode is a scuffed git clone function using git2.
Entering "self" as the URL will clone kierancli's repository. 

## Program mode.
This mode is a basic shell for running system programs eg: ls, cat neofetch.

Program mode works much better on Unix than Windows due some missunderstood PowerShell retardedness.
For example, opening another program like vim and exiting will cause kierancli to quit in PowerShell,
however Bash will keep running and return to program mode.
