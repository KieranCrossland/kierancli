# Kierancli

Kierancli uses a mode system for accessing different functionality.
the command "mode x" allows switching between different modes. currently there are 3:
mode rust (default), mode program, and mode gitclone.

## Rust mode.
This mode allows execution of hard-coded systems such as kierancli's pwd, help, etc.

## Gitclone mode.
This mode is my scuffed git clone function using git2.
Entering "self" as the URL will clone this repository, 
this could theoretically be used as a self-updater since the programs presumably not in any package manager. 

## Program mode.
This mode is a basic shell for running system programs eg: ls, cat neofetch.
